### Workplace

I am currently a university student at the [**National and Kapodistrian University of Athens**](https://www.uoa.gr), studying in the department of [**Computer Science and Telecommunication**](https://www.di.uoa.gr)

### Experience

* I've been a Minecraft Server Developer creating Plugins for a custom server of mine with [**Skript**](https://skripthub.net) for around four years, with the server itself still being under development.

* I have a little experience with [**Unity**](https://unity.com) and **C-Sharp (C#)**, having made a few projects there.

* My main language as of now is **Python**, where I design most of my projects and try out new things. Most of my recent projects I worked, or am still working on can be found [**here**](https://github.com/Herosteve0/PythonScripts).
